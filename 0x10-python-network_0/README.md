0x10. Python - Network #0
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
All your Bash scripts should be exactly 3 lines long (wc -l file should print 3)
All your files should end with a new line
All your files must be executable
The first line of all your bash files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
All curl commands must have the option -s (silent mode)
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
The first line of all your Python files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your modules should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
All your classes should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

6. Find a peak
Technical interview preparation:

You are not allowed to google anything
Whiteboard first
Write a function that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.

Prototype: def find_peak(list_of_integers):
You are not allowed to import any module
Your algorithm must have the lowest complexity (hint: you don’t need to go through all numbers to find a peak)
6-peak.py must contain the function
6-peak.txt must contain the complexity of your algorithm: O(log(n)), O(n), O(nlog(n)) or O(n2)
Note: there may be more than one peak in the list
