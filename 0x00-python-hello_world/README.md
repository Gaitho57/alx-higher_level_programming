0x00. Python - Hello, World
Welcome to the Higher Level Learning Language (HLLL) project in the ALX program! In this project, I will be exploring the Python programming language as my first higher-level learning language. Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly language widely used for various applications such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.
Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide me with a solid foundation in Python programming and help me understand its key concepts, syntax, and best practices. Throughout the project, I will engage in a series of exercises and assignments designed to gradually enhance my Python skills. By the end, I should feel comfortable writing Python code and be ready to tackle more complex projects.
Learning Objectives

    Understand the basic syntax and structure of Python.
    Learn about Python data types and built-in functions.
    Explore control flow structures such as loops and conditional statements.
    Familiarize myself with functions, modules, and packages in Python.
    Discover object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python.
    Gain exposure to file handling and exception handling in Python.
    Learn about Python libraries and frameworks for specific applications.

0. Run Python file
mandatory
Write a Shell script that runs a Python script.
The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE
1. Run inline 
Write a Shell script that runs Python code.
The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE
2. Hello, print 
Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
Use the function print
3. Print integer 
Complete this source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.

    You can find the source code here
    The output of the script should be:
        the number, followed by Battery street,
        followed by a new line
    You are not allowed to cast the variable number into a string
    Your code must be 3 lines long
    You have to use f-strings tips
4. Print float 
Complete the source code in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.

    You can find the source code here
    The output of the program should be:
        Float:, followed by the float with only 2 digits
        followed by a new line
    You are not allowed to cast number to string
    You have to use f-strings
5. Print string
Complete this source code in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters.

    You can find the source code here
    The output of the program should be:
        3 times the value of str
        followed by a new line
        followed by the 9 first characters of str
        followed by a new line
    You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statement
    Your program should be maximum 5 lines long

6. Play with strings
mandatory
Complete this source code to print Welcome to Holberton School!

    You can find the source code here
    You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements.
    You have to use the variables str1 and str2 in your new line of code
    Your program should be exactly 5 lines long
7. Copy - Cut - Paste 
Complete this source code

    You can find the source code here
    You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
    Your program should be exactly 8 lines long
    word_first_3 should contain the first 3 letters of the variable word
    word_last_2 should contain the last 2 letters of the variable word
    middle_word should contain the value of the variable word without the first and last letters
8. Create a new sentence
Complete this source code to print object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line.

    You can find the source code here
    You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
    Your program should be exactly 5 lines long
    You are not allowed to create new variables
    You are not allowed to use string literals
9. Easter Egg
Write a Python script that prints “The Zen of Python”, by TimPeters, followed by a new line.
Your script should be maximum 98 characters long (please check with wc -m 9-easter_egg.py)
10. Linked list cycle
Technical interview preparation:

    You are not allowed to google anything
    Whiteboard first
    This task and all future technical interview prep tasks will include checks for the efficiency of your solution, i.e. is your solution’s runtime fast enough, does your solution require extra memory usage / mallocs, etc.

Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

    Prototype: int check_cycle(listint_t *list);
    Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle

Requirements:

    Only these functions are allowed: write, printf, putchar, puts, malloc, free
